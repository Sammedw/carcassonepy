# carcassonepy
To simulate games using the developed agents, run the test.py script using Python 3.9 or greater. For example: 
`/bin/python3.9 /dcs/20/u2013334/Documents/CS310/carcassonepy/test.py`

A text interface will be provided that collects the number of games to play, the number of agents to use and the file where results should be logged. Then the configuration of each agent should be specified. If one of the agents provided is "human" then actions can be inputted on their turn. The tiles used in the game can be configured by editing *sets.py*.
